# Bootstrap Components

## Carousel

The Carousel is a slideshow for cycling through images, text, etc. Slides will change every few seconds.

To add the Carousel to our Favourite Place Detailed View Section Page, we used Bootstrap Carousel Component with the Indicators.

You can add the different images in the Carousel by changing the image URL in the value of the HTML `src` attribute.

```HTML
<img
  class="d-block w-100"
  src="https://d1tgh8fmlzexmh.cloudfront.net/ccbp-static-website/tajmahal-c1-img.png"
  alt="..."
/>
/>
```
